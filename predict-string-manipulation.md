Take a minute to study the Python code below.

```python
full_name = 'Taylor Swift'
print(len(full_name))
```

### Questions
Answer these questions about the code snippets.  

1. What specifically will the result be when you run the script shown above?  
> it would make a variable named "full_name" assigning a data type of "string" to it and then asign the value "Taylor Swift" to it. the second line would find the length of the variable "full_name" set the data type to an 'integer' then put the value into the terminal


2. What do you think the output (result) would be if you ran the following code snippet?
```python
full_name = 'Taylor Swift'
num_chars = len(full_name)
print(num_chars)
```
